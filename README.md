# WorkPro Station
The application is designed to enable line managers to efficiently monitor the workstation status, inventory levels, and manage order queues. The app is developed using the C++ programming language and utilizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), multi-threading, and system-level programming concepts to provide an efficient and reliable solution for workstation management. The app is designed to automatically fill orders based on stock availability and generate reports that help identify improvement areas in the production process.

The OOP paradigm is used to organize the codebase and make it more modular and scalable. The app uses classes and objects to encapsulate the data and behavior of the various entities in the system, such as workstations, inventory, and orders. This makes the code easier to read and maintain, as well as reducing the risk of errors and bugs.

Multi-threading is used to improve the app's performance by allowing it to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. For example, the app can monitor the workstation status while filling orders and generating reports at the same time. This makes the app more responsive and efficient, reducing the overall processing time and increasing productivity.

System-level programming is used to interact with the operating system and hardware at a low-level, providing access to system resources such as memory, I/O, and processes. This allows the app to efficiently manage resources and optimize performance, resulting in faster and more reliable processing.

The app's functionality includes real-time monitoring of the workstation status, inventory levels, and order queues. The app can automatically fill orders based on stock availability, reducing the need for manual intervention and improving efficiency. The app can also generate reports that help identify improvement areas in the production process, allowing the line managers to make informed decisions and optimize the workflow.
